# Christiano-Ronaldo---Goal-Prediction

It is a Problem Which I got During the ZS Data Science Challenge From Interview Bit Hiring Challenge Where I secured a 40th Rank out of 10,000 Students across India. It is a Dataset which requires Intensive Cleaning and Processing. Here I have Performed Classification Using Random Forest Classifier and Used Hyper Tuning of the Parameters to achieve the Accuracy. I got a very Satisfiable Accuracy from the Model in both the Training and Testing Sets.
